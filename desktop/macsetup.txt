- Open Terminal
- Open Terminal’s Preferences
- Select the style you have set as default (or the style you wish to change the key mappings in.)
- Select the Keyboard “tab”
- Select the “end” key from the list
- Click the “Edit” button under the list
- Change the “Action” from “scroll to end of buffer” to “send string to shell:”
- There’s a text field under the drop-down you just changed. This field is where the keycode for the end key needs to be entered.
- The following are the keycodes you’ll need to know:
- End Key: \033[4~
- Home Key: \033[1~
- Pg. Down: \033[6~
- Pg. Up: \033[5~

- To get the \033 portion of the key code, you need to hit the Esc key when the text field has focus, then just type the rest of the key code in as displayed. Note that the Delete key will enter its own key code into the field. To delete a mistyped character, click the “Delete one character” button just below the text field.
- Do the same for the Home, Pg. Down and Pg. Up keys. 
- Open a new terminal window and your keys should work as expected.
